        <AboutText>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
        but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you,
        I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides,
        I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
        <br />
        Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house,
        fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?
